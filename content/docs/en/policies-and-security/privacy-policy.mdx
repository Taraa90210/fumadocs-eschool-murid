**eSchool Privacy Policy**

### Our Privacy Commitment

eSchool is fully committed to maintaining and protecting the privacy of all its users — including schools, teachers, students, and parents. We only collect data that is **strictly necessary** to support digital academic and administrative operations.

We **do not sell, share, or monetize personal data** in any form to third parties, including for advertising purposes. Even for free versions of the service, we **never have—and never will—generate revenue from user personal data**.

The purpose of this policy is to provide transparency to you regarding:

* The types of data collected
* How data is used and stored
* Your rights over data control

We strive to use clear and easy-to-understand language because we believe privacy is a fundamental right of every individual, including in the educational environment.

#### Policy Scope

This policy applies to:

* **All eSchool digital services and products**, including:
  * eSchool Mobile Application (Android/iOS)
  * eSchool Web Admin & Siakad Dashboard
  * Integrated official APIs & third-party systems
* All interactions through official forms, help services, and eSchool digital communications

However, it **does not apply** to third parties or services that have separate privacy policies (e.g., video conference service providers, external payment applications, etc.).

#### Privacy Policy Structure
