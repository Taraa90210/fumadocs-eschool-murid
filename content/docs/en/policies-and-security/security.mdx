### eSchool System Security

#### Our Commitment to Educational Data Security

**eSchool** is an integrated Software as a Service (SaaS)-based platform used by thousands of schools to manage academic, administrative, and communication activities. Security is a core principle in the development of all our services — from the system, human resources, to operational processes.

#### Organizational Security

We implement an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** that refers to best practices in the education technology industry. This system considers our security objectives as well as risks that may impact schools, teachers, students, and parents who are active eSchool users.

Some basic principles we hold:

* **Data Confidentiality**: User personal information will not be shared with third parties without permission.
* **Data Integrity**: All academic and administrative data is safe-guarded from unauthorized manipulation or access.
* **System Availability**: eSchool operates with high uptime and a reliable backup system.

#### Our Team's Background Check

All development and support staff for the eSchool system have gone through a selection and **background verification** process, including professional and educational records. This is to ensure only trusted personnel have access to school and user data.

#### Transparency and Compliance

We continuously update security policies in accordance with education and digital technology regulations applicable in Indonesia. We are open to security audits and feedback from school partners to create a safe, comfortable, and trusted digital environment for all users.
