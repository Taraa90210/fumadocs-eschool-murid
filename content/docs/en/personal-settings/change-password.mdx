### Change Password

The **Change Password** feature allows users to enhance account security by creating a new, stronger password.

1. Open the **Change Password** page through the settings menu.
2. Enter your **current password** in the first field.
3. Enter the **new password** you want to use.
4. The system will automatically assess the **security level** of your new password (Weak, Medium, Strong, or Very Strong).
5. To proceed, the new password must meet the following requirements:
   * Minimum 8 characters
   * Contains **uppercase letters (A–Z)**
   * Contains **lowercase letters (a–z)**
   * **(Optional, but recommended)**: Numbers (0–9) and special characters (!@#$...)
   * Does not contain consecutive character repetitions (e.g.: aaa, 123)
6. Re-enter the **new password confirmation** to ensure there are no typos.
7. If the password does not meet the standards, the save button will be disabled and a warning message will appear: **"Password Does Not Meet Standards"**.
8. If the password meets the standards, the save button will be active and the message "Update Password" will appear.

💡 _Security Tips:_\
Use a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to create a stronger and harder-to-guess password.
