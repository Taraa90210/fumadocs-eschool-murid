**Quick Access, Light Navigation, and Academic Information in Your Palm**

## Simple Navigation & Focus on Learning

The **eSchool Mobile app for Students** is designed with a **concise, intuitive, and user-friendly** interface. All main features are displayed structurally according to student needs, making it easy to access materials, schedules, assignments, and grades — whenever and wherever.


## Main Functions on the Dashboard

The dashboard page presents relevant real-time information that supports students' daily learning activities, such as:

* Today's class schedule
* Pending assignments
* Latest grades from assignments or exams
* Important notifications and school announcements

With this interface, students can directly view daily activities without needing to open each menu manually.

## Data Display in the Mobile Menu

Every menu in the student application (Assignments, Grades, Schedule, and Attendance) has been optimized for mobile devices. The display is **easy to read**, **lightweight**, and **responsive**, without compromising the core functions of each module.
