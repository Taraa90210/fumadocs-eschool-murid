# Issue: User Cannot Login

### **Account Not Yet Registered**

eSchool Mobile **does not provide self-registration** for individual users. The account activation process is carried out centrally through schools that have been officially registered by the eSchool team.

#### How to Access eSchool Mobile:

1. **The school must first register officially** via the eSchool Siakad website by pressing the **"Register Your School"** button.
2. After filling out the registration form, the eSchool team will perform the school activation process.
3. The eSchool team will create a primary admin account for the principal/operator and provide initial login access.
4. **The school admin can then create accounts for:**
   * Teachers
   * Students
   * Parents/Guardians
5. User accounts will be sent via email or the school's official communication media.

### **Logging into the Mobile Application**

Once the account is created by the school admin:

* Download the **eSchool Mobile** application via:
  * [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.ac.eschool.GuruStaff.android\&hl=id) for Android devices
  * [Apple App Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.ac.eschool.GuruStaff.android\&hl=id) for iOS devices
* Login using the **official account** provided by the school
* After a successful login, you can immediately use features according to your role (teacher, student, or parent)

### ⚠️ **Important to Know**

* There is no **Sign Up** feature directly from the application
* **Individuals (teachers/students/parents)** cannot create their own accounts
* The entire eSchool usage process **must start from the school**
