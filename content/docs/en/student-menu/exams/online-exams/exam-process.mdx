#### Exam Security Mechanism

To maintain exam integrity and prevent cheating, the system applies the following important rules:

* **Screenshots Disabled**\
  Students cannot take screenshots while the exam is in progress.
* **Active Alarm when Exiting the Application**\
  If a student leaves the application while the exam is in progress, the system will immediately trigger a **warning alarm**.
* **Auto-Submit If Not Returned within 5 Seconds**\
  If the student does not return to the application within **more than 5 seconds**, the system will automatically **submit the exam results**, even if not yet finished.
