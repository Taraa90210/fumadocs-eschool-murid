### Assignment List Page

Before working on an assignment, you will be directed to the **assignment list** page. This page is the primary place to see all assignments given by teachers.

1. Open the **eSchool Mobile** app, then tap the **Assignments** icon at the bottom of the screen.
2. Here, you will see two tabs:
   * **Assigned**: Displays assignments that you still need to work on.
   * **Submitted**: Displays assignments that you have already sent.
3. You can filter assignments by **subject** by tapping the subject name like PKN, BIG, BIN, and others.
4. Use the **Sort By** button to organize the assignment list as needed, such as:
   * Most recently or oldest assigned
   * Closest or farthest due date
5. Each assignment will display:
   * Assignment title
   * Subject
   * Created date and deadline
   * Collection status (e.g.: **Not Submitted**)
6. When you're ready, just **tap one of the assignments** to enter the [assignment details](assignment-details) page. There you can read instructions, write your answer, and submit it directly!
