# **Assignments Page (Student)**

The **Assignments** page is designed to make it easier for students to monitor all assignment activities related to learning. This view consists of two main parts: **Assigned** and **Submitted**, which can be accessed through the top navigation tabs.

## Key Features:

1. **Subject Filter:** Students can select "All Subjects" or directly filter by subjects such as BIG, PKN, BIN, and others to focus on specific assignment searches.
2. **Assignment List:** Displays assignments based on the collection date and work status:
   * **Assignment Title**: Concise and clear.
   * **Subject**: Labeled in light blue for high visibility.
   * **Due Date**: Equipped with a calendar icon to highlight the deadline.
   * **Status**:
     * _Received \[grade]_ – indicates the assignment has been graded.
     * _Submitted_ – the assignment has been sent but not yet graded.

3. **Interactive Design:**

   * Illustrations for each assignment make the interface more attractive and informative.
   * Assignment status and colors are adjusted so students can quickly distinguish between those that are finished and those still in process.
   * Bottom navigation remains available for quick access to other pages (home, tasks, and other main menus).
