#### **Assignments Page (Student)**

The **Assignments** page is designed to make it easier for students to monitor all assignment activities related to learning. This view consists of two main parts: **Assigned** and **Submitted**, which can be accessed through the top navigation tabs.

**🔍 Key Features:**

* **Subject Filter:** Students can select "All Subjects" or directly filter by subjects such as BIG, PKN, BIN, and others to focus on specific assignment searches.
* **Assignment List:** Displays assignments based on the collection date and work status:
  * **Assignment Title**: Concise and clear.
  * **Subject**: Labeled in light blue for high visibility.
  * **Due Date**: Equipped with a calendar icon to highlight the deadline.
  * **Status**:
    * ✅ _Received \[grade]_ – indicates the assignment has been graded.
    * 📤 _Submitted_ – the assignment has been sent but not yet graded.

**🧾 Interactive Design:**

* Illustrations for each assignment make the interface more attractive and informative.
* Assignment status and colors are adjusted so students can quickly distinguish between those that are finished and those still in process.
* Bottom navigation remains available for quick access to other pages (home, tasks, and other main menus).
