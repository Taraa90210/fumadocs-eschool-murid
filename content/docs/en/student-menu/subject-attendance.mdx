#### **Subject Attendance – Attendance Recap Per Subject**

The **Subject Attendance** page is designed to display students' attendance history in detail based on each subject followed on a given day. This information is presented in real-time and structurally, making it easier for students to monitor their involvement in daily learning.

**Features and Information Displayed:**

* **Date and Active Day**: Displayed at the top and can be scrolled to previous or subsequent dates with arrow buttons, allowing users to see attendance for other days.
* **Subject List**: Arranged in order based on class periods.
* **Subject Name** (e.g.: MAT, KKA, PAI).
* **Lesson Time**: Displayed with a clock icon (⏰), indicating start and end times (e.g.: 07:00 – 09:00).
* **Attendance Status**: Labeled with a green tag for “✅ Present”, confirming student attendance in that session.
* **Lesson Material**: Displayed below the lesson time, providing information about the learning topics discussed by the teacher that day (e.g.: _algorithms_, _Competing in Goodness_).

**Focus on Student Convenience:**

* Students can **monitor attendance per class period**, not just overall.
* **Learned Material** is displayed so students stay connected with the taught topics, including for reviewing material if they were unable to attend.
* Intuitive and fast navigation to view attendance on other days.
* A clean visual interface, familiar icons, and attendance notifications make it easy for students to read information at a single glance.
