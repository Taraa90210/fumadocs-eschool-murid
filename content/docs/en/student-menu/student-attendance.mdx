The **Attendance** page in the eSchool Mobile app is designed to help students independently monitor their monthly attendance history. This feature provides a simple yet informative visual overview of daily school attendance records.



## Calendar Navigation



Students can navigate between months using the left and right arrow icons at the top. The calendar is displayed in a monthly format so students can see their attendance activity comprehensively.



## Daily Attendance Indicators



Each date in the calendar displays the attendance status. Usually marked with specific colors or symbols (depending on implementation), for example:



* 🟢 Present

* 🔴 Absent

* 🟡 Excused

* ⚪️ Empty (no data)



## Monthly Attendance Summary



Below the calendar, there are two information cards:



* **Total Present**: Total days the student attended during that month.

* **Total Absent**: Total absences for the student in that month.



This feature helps students become more responsible for their attendance and provides awareness of their discipline level recorded in the school system.
