#### **Subject Attendance – Detailed Monitoring of Child's Attendance**

The **Subject Attendance** page for parents/guardians is designed as a means to monitor student attendance in detail based on the daily lesson schedule. With a neat and intuitive visual interface, this page gives a complete overview regarding the child's learning activities while at school.

**Day and Date Display**

* Parents can view attendance data based on a **specific date**.
* The date is displayed at the top of the page and can be easily navigated using the left and right arrow buttons.
* The date is adjusted to the active academic calendar, so parents only see data on school days.

**Provided Information**

Each information block presents:

* **Subject Name (Example: BIG - English)** displayed clearly.
* **Student Attendance Status**: A green “✅ Present” label will appear if the child is present in that subject.
* **Lesson Time**: Displayed in a time range (e.g., 12:20 – 15:00), helping parents know their child's active time at school.
* **Learning Material**: Displays the topic or content of the lesson studied by the child in that session (e.g., _Events_), giving parents insight into the child's academic progress.

**Focus for Parents/Guardians:**

* **Facilitates daily monitoring** of child attendance without waiting for manual recaps from the school.
* Provides **transparent information** not only regarding attendance but also ongoing learning content.
* Helps parents **establish appropriate communication with the child** or homeroom teacher based on the available data.
* Designed to be intuitive even for users not yet accustomed to digital applications.
