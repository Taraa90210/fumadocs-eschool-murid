#### **Teachers Page – Information and Fast Access for Parents & Students**

On the **Teachers** page, users can see the list of teachers who teach at the school. Each entry displays the **teacher's name**, **subject**, **lesson type** (e.g., Theory), and a **copiable phone number**. The interface is designed to be simple and easy to read for both students and parents.

**Key Features:**

* **Teacher List**: Displayed in informative cards, complete with profile icons.
* **Subjects**: Displayed under the teacher's name (e.g., _MULOK BJ – Theory_).
* **Phone Number**: Directly visible with a **copy to clipboard** feature using the 📋 icon so users can copy the number with a single tap.
* **Teacher Details**: When one of the teacher cards is clicked, a pop-up (bottom sheet) will appear, showing the teacher's information again with more focus, including the copy button for the number.

**Convenience and Accessibility:**

* Parents or students can directly copy the number to contact teachers if needed, such as for learning consultation, attendance, or other academic coordination.
* A clean design focused on readability to be easily accessible for all ages.

This page serves as a bridge between the school and application users, providing transparency and direct contact access to the teachers responsible for specific subjects.
