The **Attendance** page in the eSchool Mobile application for parents displays a child's attendance summary in an intuitive and easy-to-understand calendar format. This feature helps parents monitor their child's learning discipline directly through the application.

#### Monthly Navigation

Use the right or left arrow icons at the top to switch months and view the complete attendance history of the child.

#### Calendar View

Each date is displayed in a monthly calendar format. The child's attendance status will be marked with different colors (if available), such as:

* 🟢 **Present**
* 🔴 **Absent**
* 🟡 **Permit (Excused)**
* ⚪️ **Not Available**

#### Total Summary

At the bottom of the page, there are two summary boxes:

* **Present Count**: Total days the child was present in that month.
* **Absent Count**: Total child absences.

With simple and informative visuals, parents can easily identify their child's attendance patterns and take action if necessary.
