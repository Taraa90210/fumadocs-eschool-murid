#### **Child's Assignment List (Guardian)**

**Monitor Child's Academic Assignments in Real-Time**

The **Assignment List** feature on the parent portal makes it easy to view and monitor all assignments received or submitted by the child. This page presents data transparently and structurally so that parents can be more involved in supporting the child's learning process at home.

    → Parents can see which assignments the child still needs to work on.
* **Submitted**:\

  * **Final grade if already corrected by the teacher**\
    → Parents can monitor the results and progress of the child's grades from each assignment.

* **Filter by Subject**:\
  Parents can filter the assignment list by subjects such as English, Indonesian, Religion, and others.
* **Concise Visual Display**:\
  Icons, color labels, and a concise design help users easily distinguish between active and completed assignments.
