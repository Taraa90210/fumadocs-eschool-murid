# **Reports Page – Select Subject**

On this page, parents can access **their child's academic progress reports** based on each subject.

Before viewing detailed reports such as assignments and online exams, parents **must select a subject** first.

## Display Description:

* Each subject is displayed in the form of **icon boxes with images** accompanied by short subject codes (example: BIG, PKN, BIN, MAT, PJOK).
* The design is arranged in a **3-column grid**, making it easy for parents to quickly find subjects.
* The subject list includes all types of study fields, both general and vocational (example: AIJ-T, TLJ-T, PKKKwu, MPP MTK, MPP BK).

## Additional Notes:

* This display **functions as an initial gateway** before entering the detailed report view.
* After a subject is selected, parents will be directed to a specific report page consisting of two main tabs: **Assignments** and **Online Exams**.
