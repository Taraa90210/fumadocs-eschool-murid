## How to Submit a Permit:

1. Open the **Permit** menu from the main application view.
2. If no permit application has been made today, a message will appear:\
   **"No Permit Data for Today!"**
3. Press the **( + )** button in the bottom right corner to submit a new permit.
4. Fill in the permit application form:
   * **Date**: Select the permit date.
   * **Reason**: Write the reason for absence (e.g., Sick).
   * **Permit Type**: Select one: `Sick` or `Permit`.
   * **Attachment** (optional but recommended): Upload supporting files such as a doctor's note or other documents (PDF/JPG).
5. Once all data is filled, press the **Send** button.

_Note:_ Permits can only be submitted **once per day**.

## After Permit Submission:

* The application status will appear in the permit list, for example:
  * **Type**: Sick
  * **Status**: Pending (awaiting approval)
  * **Date & reason for permit**
  * **Attachment**: Can be viewed again via the **View** button

This feature simplifies the permit notification process digitally and helps the school in verifying data directly.

If issues occur while submitting a permit, ensure the internet connection is stable and the attachment file does not exceed the size limit.
